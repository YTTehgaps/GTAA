# GTAA
This project was born yesterday.  
Read the documentation via the github wiki https://github.com/YTTehgaps/GTAA/wiki.

Currently this project is backed by a whole team of two people. There's heaps of reasons you'd want to join this. I think the most important one is having the cars do the thriller routine to 'Never Gonna Give You Up', by Rick Astley.
Woah, that's way too much SEO for a little hidden project like this... Oh no, and now I used SEO!! What if we get an Alexa Ranking?!
