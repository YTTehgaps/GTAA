# GTAA
This project was born yesterday.  
Read the documentation via the github wiki https://github.com/YTTehgaps/GTAA/wiki.

Currently this project is backed by a whole team of two people. There's heaps of reasons you'd want to join this. I think the most important one is having the cars do *The Thriller* routine to '**Never Gonna Give You Up**', by Rick Astley.
Woah, that's way too much SEO for a little hidden project like this...  
Oh no, and now I used **SEO**!! What if we get an _Alexa Ranking?!_
